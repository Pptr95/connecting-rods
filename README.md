# connecting-rods
The computer vision system is able to:
    - classify the different types of rods (whether a rod has one or more holes)
    - separate touching rods
    - find barycentre of each rod
    - find rods orientation and calculate their barycentre width
    - is able to classify rods from other kind of blobs that could appear
    - the system works also with noise that iron powder could bring
